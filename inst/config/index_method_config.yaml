    Time Product Dummy (TPD), also known as Fixed Effects Window Splice (FEWS)

    The TPD approach models price against time and a unique ID for each product, where the product id can be seen as representing the 'bundles' of
    all the price-determining characteristics (features) of that product, to produce a fully quality-adjusted price index from the parameters estimated for time.
    A new product must have at least two observations before it is non-trivially incorporated into the calculation, which means that a splice method
    other than the (latest) movement splice must be used, to ensure that the index isn't biased away from the impact of new products. For example, the window splice
    which is the original formulation of the method presented as the FEWS index

    GEKS Jevons (GEKS-J)

    The GEKS method is the product of many bilateral comparisons that maximises the number of paired price points while being free of chain drift.
